1)Binary Array-QuickSort
2)array with three values - Quicksort
3)Array of size n and small ranged values - Counting Sort Extra space will be required
4)array of size n square and n cube or closer - Radix Sort O(n) time O(n) Extra Space 5) array where is distributed uniformly across the range- Bucket Sort
6)When memory writes are costly - Selection sort or Cycle sort (Optimal algorithm in terms of memory writes)
7)When adjacent swaps are allowed - Bubble Sort Cocktail sort (Optimal Sort)
8)When array size is small - Insertion sort
) When available extra space is less - Shell sort O(n\*(logn)2 )

##General Purpose Sorting Algorithm
Merge Sort (Stable sort, also works with linked list , Divide and conquer)
Heap Sort
Quick Sort (Fastest all of them,Divide and COnquer)

##Hybrid Algorithm(Used in Libraries)
Time Sort
Intro Sort
